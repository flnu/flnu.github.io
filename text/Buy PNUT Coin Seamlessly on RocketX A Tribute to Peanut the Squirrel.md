This guide explores the origins of PNUT, its technical features, and how to purchase it on RocketX Exchange while navigating the broader landscape of meme coin investments.  

## The Emotional Story Behind PNUT  

### A Viral Mascot for Animal Welfare  
PNUTâ€™s journey began with an act of compassion. Mark Longo rescued an injured squirrel named Peanut, whose playful antics and heartwarming presence quickly captivated social media audiences. With over 600,000 followers, Peanut became a symbol of animal welfare advocacy. Her story inspired the creation of **Peanutâ€™s Freedom Farm**, a nonprofit sanctuary housing over 300 rescued animals.  

Tragedy struck when New York authorities confiscated Peanut, citing health concerns. Her euthanasia over rabies fears sparked widespread outrage, drawing attention from public figures like Elon Musk and Donald Trump. This emotional catalyst fueled the creation of the PNUT tokenâ€”a digital tribute to Peanutâ€™s legacy.

Within 24 hours of Elon Muskâ€™s tweet about Peanut, PNUTâ€™s market cap surged from $3 million to $140 million. Binanceâ€™s decision to list the token further cemented its status in the crypto world.
