# What Is Bitcoin Pizza Day?

Bitcoin Pizza Day, celebrated annually on May 22, marks a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency history. This day commemorates the first documented purchase of physical goods using Bitcoin, when Laszlo Hanyecz, a Florida-based programmer and early Bitcoin miner, traded 10,000 BTC for two large pizzas in 2010. The event symbolizes Bitcoin's transition from a theoretical concept to a practical medium of exchange, laying the groundwork for its global adoption.

## The Story Behind Bitcoin's First Real-World Transaction

### Laszlo Hanyecz: Early Bitcoin Enthusiast  
In the nascent days of Bitcoin, Laszlo Hanyecz was among the first to mine the cryptocurrency. During this period, miners earned 50 BTC per block, making it feasible to accumulate large quantities. By 2010, Hanyecz had amassed a significant holding, which he sought to put to practical use.  

On May 18, 2010, he posted on the Bitcointalk forum, offering 10,000 BTC for two large pizzas. Despite skepticism about Bitcoin's value (with BTC priced below $0.01 at the time), a user named Jeremy Sturdivant fulfilled the request on May 22. The pizzas, purchased from Papa John's, became a historic footnote in blockchain lore.

### The Transaction That Shaped Bitcoin's Future  
Hanyecz later reflected on the purchase as a defining moment that validated Bitcoin's utility. "It made [Bitcoin] real for some people," he told CBS in 2019. The transaction demonstrated how cryptocurrency could facilitate everyday commerce, inspiring early adopters to explore its potential beyond digital experimentation.

## The Staggering Value of Bitcoin Over Time

### From Pizzas to Millions  
At the time of the transaction, 10,000 BTC was worth roughly $41. However, Bitcoin's meteoric rise transformed this seemingly trivial purchase into a legendary tale. By 2021, when Bitcoin reached its peak price of $68,990, Hanyecz's 10,000 BTC would have been valued at **$689.9 million**â€”enough to buy **45.99 million pizzas** at $15 each.

### Bitcoin's Value Milestones  
| Year | BTC Price (USD) | Value of 10,000 BTC (USD) | Equivalent Pizzas ($15 Each) |  
|------|------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|  
| 2010 | $0.0041          | $41                        | 2.7                           |  
| 2013 | $1,000           | $10,000,000                | 666,667                       |  
| 2017 | $20,000          | $200,000,000               | 13,333,333                    |  
| 2021 | $68,990          | $689,900,000               | 45,993,333                    |
