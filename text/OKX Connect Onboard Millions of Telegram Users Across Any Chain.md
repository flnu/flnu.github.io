# OKX Connect: Onboard Millions of Telegram Users Across Any Chain  

## Telegramâ€™s Explosive Growth as a Blockchain Hub  
With over **950 million active users**, Telegram has evolved into a powerful platform for blockchain innovation. Its vast, engaged audience offers developers unparalleled access to a growing demographic eager to explore decentralized applications (dApps). The platformâ€™s mini-app functionality allows seamless onchain interactions, making it a prime environment for projects to scale.  

Popular dApps like Hamster Kombat, Catizen, Yescoin, and Dogs have already demonstrated Telegramâ€™s potential by attracting tens of millions of users, many of whom are new to blockchain. These projects highlight how Telegramâ€™s user-friendly interface and social features can democratize access to Web3 technologies.  

## Beyond TON: The Multi-Chain Future of Telegramâ€™s Ecosystem  
While The Open Network (TON) remains central to Telegramâ€™s blockchain integration, the platform is rapidly embracing a **multi-chain ecosystem**. Developers are now experimenting with integrations on networks like BNB Chain, Solana, and NEAR, expanding the scope of onchain activities within Telegram mini-apps.  

For instance:  
- **CodexField Wallet** operates on BNB Chain  
- **Alpha Dex** leverages Solanaâ€™s high-speed transactions  
- **Hot Wallet** utilizes NEARâ€™s user-friendly infrastructure  

This diversification ensures developers can choose blockchains aligned with their project goals while still tapping into Telegramâ€™s massive user base. With TON already integrated and EVM networks gaining traction, Telegram is positioned as a cross-chain hub for blockchain services.
