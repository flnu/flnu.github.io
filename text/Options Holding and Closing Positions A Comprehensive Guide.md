To view active positions:

## Profit Calculation Framework  

### BTC Options Example  
| Metric            | Value          |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Entry Price        | 0.0030 BTC     |
| Exit Price         | 0.0040 BTC     |
| Contract Multiplier| 0.1 BTC        |
| Quantity           | 2 contracts    |

**Profit Formula**:  
*(Exit Price - Entry Price) Ã— Contract Multiplier Ã— Quantity*  
*(0.004 - 0.003) Ã— 0.1 Ã— 2 = 0.0002 BTC*  

**Note**: Transaction fees and funding rates may affect net returns

## Critical Price Mechanisms Explained  

### Three Essential Price Components  
| Price Type       | Function                          | Importance                  |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Latest Trade     | Real-time execution price         | Immediate execution reference |
| Index Price      | Weighted average across exchanges | Market-wide valuation       |
| Mark Price       | Risk-adjusted valuation model     | Funding rate determination  |

**Pro Tip**: Monitor mark price deviations to anticipate funding payments in perpetual contracts

## Risk Management Essentials  

### Position Sizing Calculator  
| Account Size | Max Risk per Trade | Position Size |
|--------------|--------------------|---------------|
| $10,000      | 2% ($200)          | $200/ATR      |
| $50,000      | 1.5% ($750)        | $750/ATR      |

*ATR = Average True Range (30-period)*  

### Stop-Loss Placement Guide  
- **Volatility-adjusted**: 2Ã— 14-period ATR from entry  
- **Pattern-based**: Below head/shoulders neckline or key support levels  
- **Time-based**: 3-day timeframe for day traders

## Frequently Asked Questions  

**Q1: How do I verify successful position closure?**  
A: Check your transaction history for filled orders and confirm zero remaining position size. Contract profit/loss details appear in wallet statements.  

**Q2: What happens if my limit order doesn't execute?**  
A: Monitor order book depth and adjust price levels. Consider partial execution strategies during low liquidity periods.  

**Q3: How do funding rates affect options positions?**  
A: While traditional options don't have funding rates, perpetual contracts use them to converge with spot prices. Calculate cumulative impact over holding periods.  

**Q4: Can I partially close positions?**  
A: Yes, enter desired quantity (less than full position size) when placing close orders.  

**Q5: What's the best time to close options?**  
A: Optimize exits during high volatility periods or when technical patterns indicate reversal. Use volume profile analysis for confirmation.
