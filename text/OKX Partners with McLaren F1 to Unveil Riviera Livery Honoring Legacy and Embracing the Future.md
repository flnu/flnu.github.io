# OKX Partners with McLaren F1 to Unveil Riviera Livery: Honoring Legacy and Embracing the Future  

## A Fusion of Heritage and Innovation  

In 1968, McLaren’s M7A car marked a turning point in Formula 1 history. Not only did it secure McLaren’s first Grand Prix victory, but it also introduced the now-legendary papaya color scheme. This era was defined by partnerships with traditional sponsors—what many today call “old money.” Decades later, OKX stands alongside McLaren as a pioneer of the “new money” era, blending digital innovation with the sport’s storied legacy.  

Today, we’re proud to unveil the **Riviera-inspired livery** on McLaren’s MCL39 race cars. This design pays homage to Bruce McLaren, who tragically passed on June 2, 1970, and celebrates the evolution of Formula 1 from its traditional roots to a dynamic, technology-driven future.
