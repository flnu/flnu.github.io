## Step-by-Step Guide to Withdrawing ETH from imToken  

### 1. Launch the imToken Application  
Open the imToken app on your smartphone. Ensure you‚Äôve completed the initial setup, including backing up your recovery phrase and enabling biometric authentication for enhanced security.  

### 2. Access Your Ethereum Account  
Navigate to the **ETH** tab on the home screen. Here, you‚Äôll see your account balance, transaction history, and options for sending/receiving ETH.  

### 3. Initiate the Withdrawal Process  
Tap the **"Withdraw"** button under your ETH balance. This will open the transaction interface.  

### 4. Enter the Recipient Address and Amount  
- **Recipient Address**: Input the Ethereum address of your external wallet. Double-check for typos‚Äî**incorrect addresses result in irreversible losses**.  
- **Amount**: Specify how much ETH you wish to withdraw.  

### 5. Configure Gas Fees  
Gas fees are transaction costs paid to miners for processing Ethereum transfers. imToken automatically suggests a fee based on network congestion, but you can adjust it:  
- **Standard Fee**: Balanced speed and cost (~15‚Äì30 minutes for confirmation).  
- **High Fee**: Prioritizes your transaction during busy periods (~5‚Äì10 minutes).  
- **Low Fee**: Suitable for non-urgent transfers (~1 hour).  

| Network Congestion | Recommended Gas Fee (Gwei) | Estimated Processing Time |  
|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|  
| Low                | 10‚Äì20                      | 15‚Äì30 mins                |  
| Moderate           | 30‚Äì50                      | 5‚Äì15 mins                 |  
| High               | 60+                        | 1‚Äì5 mins                  |  

### 6. Confirm Transaction Details  
Review the withdrawal address, amount, and gas fee. Accuracy here is critical to avoid irreversible mistakes.  

### 7. Authenticate the Transaction  
Enter your wallet password or use biometric login to authorize the withdrawal.  

### 8. Monitor Transaction Status  
The transaction will be broadcast to the Ethereum network. Use a blockchain explorer like [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) to track its progress using the transaction hash provided by imToken.  

### 9. Verify Receipt in External Wallet  
Once confirmed (typically 15‚Äì30 minutes), check your external wallet‚Äôs balance to ensure the ETH has been received.
