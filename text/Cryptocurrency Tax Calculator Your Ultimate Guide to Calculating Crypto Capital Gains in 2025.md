## How Does a Cryptocurrency Tax Calculator Work?  

A **crypto tax calculator** simplifies the process of estimating tax liability from cryptocurrency transactions. By inputting specific financial data, users can determine their capital gains or losses from selling digital assets. Key variables include:  

- **Filing status** (Single, Married Filing Jointly, etc.)  
- **Ordinary income** (annual earnings outside crypto gains)  
- **Purchase price** of cryptocurrency  
- **Sale price** of cryptocurrency  
- **Deduction type** (Standard or Itemized)  

These tools automatically apply federal tax brackets and capital gains rates to calculate your potential tax burden. For example, if you sold Bitcoin held for six months at a $10,000 profit, the calculator would classify this as a **short-term capital gain** taxed at your ordinary income rate.
