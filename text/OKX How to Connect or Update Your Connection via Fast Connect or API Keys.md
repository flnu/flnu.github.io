## **FAQs**  

### **1. Why can’t I close my position on OKX?**  
**Answer:** If you’re using an OKX Copy Trading Lead account, closing positions is restricted to market price execution. Bots are incompatible with Copy Trading accounts.  

### **2. What causes a “Balance limit reached” error?**  
**Answer:** This occurs when your trade exceeds OKX’s contract or leverage limits. Adjust your trade size or leverage to comply with OKX rules.  

### **3. Why is my OKX balance showing incorrectly on 3Commas?**  
**Answer:** Ensure funds are in your **Trading Account**, not Funding, Margin, or Earn accounts. 3Commas only accesses balances in the Trading section.  

### **4. How do I transfer funds to the Trading Account on OKX?**  
**Answer:**  
1. Go to **Assets > Transfer** on OKX.  
2. Move funds from the **Funding** account to the **Trading Account**.
