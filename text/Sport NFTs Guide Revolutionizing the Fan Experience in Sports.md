## Introduction to NFTs: Redefining Ownership in the Digital Era  

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have revolutionized the concept of ownership in the digital age. Unlike fungible cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, NFTs are unique, indivisible assets that represent ownership of specific digital or physical items. Blockchain technology ensures their authenticity, scarcity, and provenance, making them ideal for industries like sports.  

### Key Features of NFTs:  
- **Provenance**: Blockchain tracks ownership history.  
- **Scarcity**: Limited editions drive value.  
- **Monetization**: Direct creator-to-fan transactions.  

Sport NFTs leverage these features to tokenize iconic moments, player cards, and exclusive experiences, transforming passive fandom into active participation.
