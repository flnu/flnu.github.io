# Cryptocurrency vs Cash: Countries Leading the Transition to a Cashless Society

As the world moves toward digital transformation, governments and financial institutions are reevaluating traditional payment methods. With rising concerns about tax evasion, security risks, and technological advancements, many nations are exploring alternatives to physical currency. This article examines how cryptocurrency and other digital payment systems are shaping the future of finance across key global economies.

## Australia's Push for a Cashless Society

The Australian Liberal Party recently proposed legislation that would make cash transactions exceeding 10,000 AUD illegal. This initiative aims to combat tax evasion while promoting the adoption of digital payment methods. According to government statements, the move is designed to encourage a smoother transition to a cashless society while maintaining financial transparency.

Under the proposed framework, transactions at or above this threshold would need to utilize electronic payment systems or checks. Additionally, these transactions would be subject to mandatory reporting requirements under existing anti-money laundering (AML) and anti-terrorism financing regulations.

Notably, cryptocurrency emerges as a viable payment option that satisfies these regulatory requirements. Major cryptocurrency exchanges already adhere to strict know-your-customer (KYC) protocols, making them compliant with government mandates. The Australian Treasury has opened public consultations on this proposal, with a deadline for feedback set for August 12. The government plans to implement cash transaction restrictions starting January 1, 2025.

## Sweden: Pioneering the Cashless Society

Sweden stands out as a global leader in cashless adoption. Currently, cash transactions account for just 2% of total payments, with less than 20% of stores willing to accept physical currency. Researchers predict that Sweden will achieve a completely cashless society by 2025, three times faster than other European nations.

The Swedish public's high trust in banking institutions has significantly contributed to this transition. Over 50% of the population now uses the country's mobile payment system, Swish, which has become integral to daily transactions.

### Sweden's Digital Payment Infrastructure

Sweden became the first European country to establish an independent payment service provider (PSP). Initially operated by Point, which was later acquired by American payment technology company VeriFone, this system now serves 475,000 retail locations and partners with 42 banks across Scandinavia and Europe.

The transition extends beyond government policy - public sentiment increasingly favors digital payments. Public transportation no longer accepts cash, and small businesses have fully embraced cashless systems through solutions like PayPass, POS terminals, and innovative offerings from local startups such as iZettle.

### Sweden's E-krona Initiative

In 2018, the Swedish Central Bank introduced the e-krona, a government-backed digital currency. While the final implementation timeline remains under review, the experimental phase focuses on evaluating how this digital currency can provide a state-guaranteed payment solution.

Gabriel SÃ¶derberg, Senior Economist at the Swedish Central Bank and Associate Professor at Uppsala University, highlights the distinction between government-issued digital currencies and traditional cryptocurrencies:

"Government-issued digital currencies differ fundamentally from decentralized cryptocurrencies. While I believe traditional cryptocurrencies won't become primary payment methods soon, I'm confident we'll see state-backed digital currencies emerge."

SÃ¶derberg also emphasizes blockchain's broader potential beyond payments:

"Blockchain technology has significant applications across various sectors, though its adoption will likely remain specialized. Researchers are exploring its potential in payment systems, but the extent of implementation remains uncertain."

### FAQ: Sweden's Cashless Transition

**Q: What makes Sweden particularly suited for a cashless society?**  
A: High public trust in financial institutions, widespread mobile technology adoption, and cultural preference for convenience have accelerated Sweden's cashless transition.

**Q: Are there any remaining challenges to Sweden's cashless ambitions?**  
A: While progress is rapid, challenges remain in ensuring accessibility for all demographics and maintaining payment system resilience during technical outages.

## Germany's Cash Transaction Considerations

Germany has traditionally maintained a strong preference for cash payments within the EU. However, in early 2016, the German Finance Ministry proposed limiting cash transactions to 5,000 euros (approximately $5,600) across Germany and the entire eurozone. Remarkably, this initiative received government support within 24 hours of its announcement.

Although the proposal faces resistance from certain segments of the German population, this development signals growing European interest in regulating large cash transactions. The potential for cryptocurrency as an alternative payment solution remains significant in this context.

### Germany's Cryptocurrency Recognition

In February 2018, Germany's Finance Ministry issued a decree recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender. According to this regulation, cryptocurrencies qualify as legitimate payment methods that can substitute traditional payment solutions in commercial transactions.

The decree also established favorable tax treatment for cryptocurrency transactions, exempting them from value-added tax (VAT) and other levies. This policy aligns with the 2016 European Court of Justice ruling that classified Bitcoin used for goods and services purchases as tax-exempt.

However, the European Court's decision allows individual EU member states to maintain their own interpretations regarding cryptocurrency classification and regulation. This flexibility enables countries to define whether cryptocurrencies represent currencies or assets within their legal frameworks.

### FAQ: Cryptocurrency Regulation in Germany

**Q: How does Germany's cryptocurrency recognition impact businesses?**  
A: The legal recognition facilitates cryptocurrency adoption in commerce, providing businesses with an alternative payment method that enjoys tax advantages.

**Q: Can other EU countries adopt different cryptocurrency approaches?**  
A: Yes, while following EU-wide rulings, individual member states maintain flexibility in classifying and regulating cryptocurrencies according to their economic priorities.

## Canada's Balanced Approach to Cashless Payments

Canada demonstrates a sophisticated financial infrastructure with its Interac national debit card system and major credit networks (Visa, MasterCard, American Express). Projections indicate that by 2030, only 10% of Canadian transactions will involve physical cash.

Despite this digital readiness, the Canadian government adopts a measured approach to cash elimination. In October 2018, the Bank of Canada raised important concerns about potential drawbacks of a fully cashless society, particularly regarding elderly populations who often prefer cash transactions over electronic alternatives.

### Evaluating Cashless Challenges

While acknowledging that transitioning to a completely cashless system wouldn't create systemic issues, the Bank of Canada emphasizes the need for greater operational reliability. This cautious perspective has led to the consideration of three strategic approaches:

1. Maintaining cash availability while implementing measures to gradually reduce its usage over time
2. Regulating existing payment networks to enhance reliability and address competitive imbalances
3. Introducing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) - distinct from cryptocurrency - that could compete directly with private payment networks

### Canada's Cryptocurrency Experimentation

In July 2018, the Bank of Canada conducted research titled "Central Bank Digital Currency and Monetary Policy," which suggested that government-issued digital currencies could boost economic welfare. The study estimated that introducing a CBDC could increase domestic consumption by 0.64% compared to the current cash economy.

Earlier in May 2018, the Bank of Canada collaborated with TMX Group and Payments Canada to verify that any asset or currency could be tokenized for instant exchange. This conclusion built upon the Jasper Project, a flagship distributed ledger technology experiment launched in June 2017 that demonstrated blockchain's effectiveness for real-time securities settlement.

### FAQ: Canada's Digital Currency Strategy

**Q: Why is Canada taking a cautious approach to cash elimination?**  
A: Canada recognizes the importance of ensuring payment system accessibility for all demographics while maintaining operational reliability during the transition.

**Q: What distinguishes Canada's CBDC from cryptocurrency?**  
A: While cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, Canada's potential CBDC would represent a digital form of Canadian dollar issued and regulated by the central bank.

## Blockchain Technology: Beyond Cryptocurrency

While cryptocurrencies capture much attention, blockchain technology's potential extends far beyond payment systems. Researchers and financial institutions worldwide are exploring its applications in various financial and non-financial domains.

The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) exemplifies this broader exploration. In September 2017, RBC began testing blockchain technology to facilitate cross-border payments between Canadian and American banks. Six months later, RBC's Toronto Technology Centre developed a system using software from Hyperledger, an open-source blockchain development consortium established in 2015.

This technology integration created a "shadow" version of RBC's general ledger, enabling real-time tracking of payments between Canada and the United States. Such implementations demonstrate how traditional financial institutions are gradually incorporating blockchain's advantages while maintaining regulatory compliance.

### FAQ: Blockchain Applications Beyond Payments

**Q: What other financial applications use blockchain technology?**  
A: Blockchain finds applications in trade settlements, smart contracts, supply chain finance, and identity verification systems across global financial institutions.

**Q: How do banks implement blockchain technology?**  
A: Banks like RBC use blockchain to create parallel transaction records, enhancing transparency and settlement efficiency while maintaining traditional banking operations.

The transition to cashless societies is no longer a futuristic concept but an ongoing reality. With mobile devices and digital payment methods becoming ubiquitous, people increasingly conduct daily transactions without physical currency. From taxi rides to coffee purchases and grocery shopping, digital payments have become seamlessly integrated into everyday life.

While the shift away from traditional cash and physical assets to electronic money appears inevitable, critical questions remain about the role of blockchain and cryptocurrency in this transformation. Will these technologies deliver on their promises of faster, more secure transactions? How will different countries balance innovation with financial regulation? The answers to these questions will shape the global financial landscape in the coming years.
