A critical support zone between $125 and $127 has repeatedly stabilized the token's price, while resistance remains at $133.50â€“$133.60. Blockchain data reveals over 32 million SOL (5% of total supply) accumulated at the $129.79 level, marking this as a pivotal price point for future movements.

### Canada Launches First Spot SOL ETFs  

North Americaâ€™s first spot Solana ETFs debuted on April 16, issued by major asset managers like 3iQ, Purpose, Evolve, and CI. This institutional milestone has amplified interest in SOL, aligning with broader adoption trends seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.  

### DEX Dominance and Market Metrics  

Solanaâ€™s resurgence in DEX activity is underscored by a 16% weekly gain and a 12% increase in total value locked (TVL), now reaching $7.08 billion. This positions Solana as the leading blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions, surpassing Ethereum in daily trading volume during peak periods.
