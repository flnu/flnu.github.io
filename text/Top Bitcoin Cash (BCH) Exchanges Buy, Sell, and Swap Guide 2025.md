## Understanding Bitcoin Cash

Born from a 2017 Bitcoin fork, BCH prioritizes transactional utility over store-of-value functions.

Unlike Bitcoin Core's SegWit upgrade, BCH's approach focuses on increasing block sizes to process ~116 transactions per second.

### Key Development Milestones:
- **2017**: Fork from Bitcoin blockchain at block 478,558
