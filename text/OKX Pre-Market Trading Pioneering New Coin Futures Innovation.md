## How OKX Pre-Market Trading Works  

### Contract Mechanics  

OKX Pre-Market Trading operates as **USDT-settled futures contracts** tied to upcoming tokens. Key features include:  

- **24/7 Trading**: Markets remain open around the clock.  
- **Index Pricing**: Contracts use the latest trade price as the reference for settlement.  
- **Flexible Position Sizing**: Adjust leverage between 0.01x and 2x.  

### Delivery Scenarios  

1. **Successful Token Launch**: Contracts settle before the token‚Äôs spot listing.  
2. **Project Cancellation**: If a token fails to launch within six months, OKX may terminate the contract.  
3. **API Integration**: Developers can track expiration dates via the `expTime` field in OKX APIs.  

## Core Features and Risk Parameters  

### Contract Specifications

| **Tick Size**           | 0.0001 USDT increments              |  
| **Leverage Range**      | 0.01x‚Äì2x                            |  

### Position Limits by User Tier  

| **Tier** | **Max Position Size (USD)** | **Maintenance Margin Rate** |

| 5        | $30,000                      | 15%                          |

## Strategic Advantages for Traders  

### 1. **Price Discovery Before Listing**

### 2. **Hedging Against Volatility**  
Traders can lock in prices via futures contracts to mitigate risks associated with sudden price swings after listing.  

### 3. **Enhanced Liquidity for New Projects**  
Projects benefit from early liquidity, which can attract institutional interest and stabilize prices post-launch.
