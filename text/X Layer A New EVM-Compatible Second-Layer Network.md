# X Layer: A New EVM-Compatible Second-Layer Network

## Introducing X1: The Future of Web3 Development

_Statement from OKX Marketing Director Haider Rafiq_

To all Web3 developers worldwide:

Today marks a transformative moment in blockchain technology. We're excited to unveil **X1**, a cutting-edge Ethereum Layer 2 network built using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs through Polygon's Chain Development Kit (CDK). This strategic collaboration between OKX and Polygon Labs represents a significant leap forward for scalable blockchain infrastructure.

X1 combines the best of two worlds: Ethereum's proven security with Polygon's innovative ZK technology. As an EVM-compatible network, X1 empowers developers to deploy applications with unprecedented efficiency while maintaining seamless interoperability with Ethereum's ecosystem.

Key advantages include:
- Native OKB token integration for gas payments
- Instant transaction finality
- Ultra-low fees through optimized ZK-SNARKs
- Immediate EVM compatibility

With today's testnet launch, X1 bridges the OKX, Polygon, and Ethereum communities, creating a unified ecosystem for next-generation Web3 applications.

## Why X1 Matters for Web3 Evolution

The blockchain industry faces a critical juncture. While Ethereum remains the most robust smart contract platform, its scalability limitations have created bottlenecks for mass adoption. X1 addresses these challenges through three fundamental innovations:

### 1. Seamless EVM Compatibility
Unlike alternative Layer 2 solutions requiring code modifications, X1 enables effortless migration of existing Ethereum dApps. Developers can deploy Solidity-based contracts without changes, preserving their existing tooling investments.

### 2. Revolutionary ZK Technology
X1 leverages Polygon CDK's advanced zero-knowledge proofs to achieve:
- 90% reduction in transaction costs
- 2-3 second finality times
- Enhanced privacy features
- Massively improved throughput

### 3. Strategic Ecosystem Integration
By combining OKX's 50M+ user base with Polygon's established developer network, X1 creates a powerful flywheel effect. This integration enables:
- Immediate liquidity access
- Cross-platform asset transfers
- Shared security guarantees
